The purpose of this terraform project is to create enough infrastructe for
developers' Hello World C# to be deployed onto a unique windows ec2 vm. It's a
factory in that each time a developer does some github thing (merg, branch, PR)
an ephemeral environment with their code deployed is created.

This is part of [a suite of
repositories](https://github.com/orgs/HylandExperience/repositories?q=topic%3Ateam-fcc+topic%3Ademo+topic%3Ahello-world)
that work together to help new developers get up to speed quickly with a .NET
`Hello World` console app running on a Windows EC2 in AWS.
